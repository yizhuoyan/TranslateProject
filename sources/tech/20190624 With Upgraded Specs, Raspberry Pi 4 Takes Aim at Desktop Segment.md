With Upgraded Specs, Raspberry Pi 4 Takes Aim at Desktop Segment
======

_**Brief: Raspberry Pi 4 is here with the upgraded technical specifications. You get up to 4 GB of RAM and you can connect two 4K displays with it. With the new hardware, you should be more comfortable using it as a desktop. Starting price remains the $35 like the previous models.**_

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has just launched the new [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B][1].

It comes with some impressive upgrades which makes one of the most powerful [single board computers][2] under $40.

### What’s new in Raspberry Pi 4?

The Raspberry Pi 4 now supports a dual 4K monitor setup – if that is what you are looking for. In addition to this, you get a more powerful processor which can be coupled with up to 4 GB of RAM. That’s almost equivalent to a mid-end laptop.

The upgraded specification makes it a competitor in the [Linux mini-PC][4] segment while the same price tag of $35 gives it an edge over [other single board computers][2].

Right after the launch, it’s almost out of stock at major online stores. So, let us take a look at what makes it so impressive.

#### Raspberry Pi 4 key specifications

You can also purchase the official Raspberry Pi 4 desktop kit that comes with a Raspberry Pi 4, its case, keyboard, mouse, micro HDMI cables, USB-C power supply, user guide and 16GB [microSD card with Raspbian installed][10].

The entire kit is in red and white color and it looks pretty (if you care for the looks). You can get the purchase information on Raspberry Pi website.

#### Raspberry Pi 4 is promising

With all that spec buff, it is definitely going to be one of the best out there. Also, instead of getting an entry-level desktop, Raspberry Pi 4 will be a better choice. You can easily access your documents, manage your spreadsheets, and do a lot of things at a cheaper price tag.

I’m definitely considering to purchase the Raspberry Pi 4 as a spare (but a powerful) entry-level desktop. Well, I won’t be going for the 4K dual monitor setup, but it surely is capable of that, at least on paper.

What do you think about the new Raspberry Pi 4 Model B? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.
